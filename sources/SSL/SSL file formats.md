There a few format for SSL related files. Here are some :

- `.csr`: *`Certificate Signing Request`*, defined in PKCS#10 ([RFC 2986](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2986)), a file that includes all the information needed for a certificate to get signed, as well as the *public key* of the said certificate.
