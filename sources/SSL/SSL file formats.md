SSL certificates come in several file formats, each serving different use cases. Here are the most common ones:

1. **PEM** (`.pem`, `.crt`, `.cer`, `.key`)
- Base64-encoded format commonly used in Apache and other web servers.
- Can store certificates, private keys, and intermediate certificates in a text format.

2. **DER** (`.der`, `.cer`)
- Binary format primarily used in Windows and Java environments.
- Contains only the certificate and does not support private keys.

3. **PFX/P12** (`.pfx`, `.p12`)
- Binary format that includes the private key along with the certificate and intermediate certificates.
- Commonly used in Windows and for importing certificates into software like IIS.

4. **CSR** (`.csr`)
- Certificate Signing Request file used to request an SSL certificate from a Certificate Authority (CA).
- Contains the public key and identifying details but not the private key.

Each format serves a different purpose depending on the server and application requirements.
